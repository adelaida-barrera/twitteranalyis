# Network analysis

# In this section we are going to visualize text data as a weighted network. The goal is to count pairwise relative occurence of words.

# Community detection
```{r}
# As Orduz (), we employ the Louvain Method for community detection, and to try to find clusters within the network. The precedent is an algorithm for detecting communities in networks. It evaluates how much more densely connected the nodes within a community are, compared to how connected they would be in a random network (neo4j, December 2020). It recursively merges communities into a single node and executes the modularity clustering on the condensed graphs.

# We see that 2 groups where identified and the modularity (measure for the “quality” of certain partition of the nodes in a network like clusterings) is 0.22. This result its not very good (better if closer to 1). Institutions have a smaller modularity then individuals.
